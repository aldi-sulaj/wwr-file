        The Albania Rafting Group is the best choice if you are looking for
        Albania Tours, as the most experienced adventure tour operator in the
        country. With us, you can explore active and wild activities such as
        rafting, canyoning, river hiking, kayaking, off road tours, hydro speed,
        SUP, snowshoeing, caravan mule, cave exploration and a complete tour to
        discover untouched beaches, all followed by the best traditional Albania
        food. Join us to explore Albania adventure tours in a truly experience
        and discover the hidden treasures of this wonderful country! The
        white-water rafting guide shouted orders from the back of the boat and
        our five-strong crew paddled hard to stay on course. We were tackling a
        stretch of the Vjosa, a 270km river that begins in Greece (where it is
        called the Aoös) and flows through Albania and into the Adriatic just
        north of the city of Vlora. I was on a recce trip for a new southern
        Albanian break with Much Better Adventures, which specialises in long
        weekends to wild places in Europe. In most of the Albanian beaches,
        you'll find some kayak boats which you can hire and enjoy the
        crystalline waters. If you want to be part of a more professional tour
        experience, Albania Adventure offers an 8 day Kayaking Tour, where
        you'll have the chance to discover some of the most unique and virgin
        beaches and bays of Albania.

      <h1 class="r-text">Osumi Canyons</h1>
      <p class="r-text2">
        Two to three million years ago, water erosion created one of the most
        recognized natural wonders of Albania: the Osumi Canyons in Skrapar. At
        a length of about 14 km, they can easily be traversed today by rafting,
        offering explorers the possibility of paddling the rubber boats under
        the shadows of imposingly high rocks. The experience of rafting and the
        majesty of this place has earned it the status of the Albanian Colorado.
        At a width ranging from 4 to 35 meters, and slopes above 100 meters,
        rafting through the canyons may last 2 to 4 hours, depending on the
        river flow. The greenery on the slopes and the eight wonderful
        waterfalls cascading down from them make the journey truly spellbinding.
        The itinerary that begins in Hambull and continues up to Çorovodë, is
        filled with stops, necessary not only for relaxation but also for
        enjoying the extraordinary nature. The best-known waterfall which
        represents an obligatory stop for all those who come here is the
        Waterfall of the Lovers, which has long since become one of the area's
        most popular postcards. Many legends enrich the reality of the area and
        it is thought that there are plenty of still-unexplored caves and nooks
        in the rocks. This wonderful and once-in-a -lifetime adventure is best
        experienced in groups of family and friends. Best period to try rafting:
        from February to June.

        <h2>More Than Just The Thrill</h2>
        <p>
          Enjoy the breathtaking scenery. From valleys, meadows, canyons, and
          high peaks; it's way more than just the rapids. It's a great way to
          get away from it all and relax amongst all the beauty of the great
          outdoors.
